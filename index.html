                        <h5>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h5>
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        My career has always been enhanced by working collaboratively. I lead teams to develop user-centered software applications using tools like GitHub for versioning and Slack as a communication tool in both architecture and software engineering tasks. This program has enhanced my experience by working with other tools and reporting my progress to professors and fellow students. I worked with colleagues to develop scalable software during my daily work and this course re-enforces the importance of adaptability and empathy in creating productive team environments.

                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        Effective communication is another essential skill I work on constantly and this course makes this a key focus. For example, I created a technical report and presentation to explain how integrating AWS Lambda and MongoDB enhanced an embedded system. By simplifying complex technical concepts for a non-technical audience, I demonstrated my ability to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders. This skill will be crucial as I pursue a career in technology, where clear and tailored communication drives successful projects.

                        <h5>Data Structures and Algorithms</h5>
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        Mastering data structures and algorithms is critical for all my work when developing efficient and scalable solutions. In one project, I designed and implemented a priority-based task scheduler for an embedded thermostat system. This required analyzing trade-offs between performance and responsiveness, ensuring that the scheduler met real-time requirements. These experiences have prepared me to design computing solutions that address complex challenges effectively.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        The program gave me a solid foundation in database management and software engineering. Modularizing the code for the Embedded Thermostat System improved readability and maintainability. This demonstrated my ability to use industry best practices. Integrating MongoDB with AWS Lambda also demonstrated my ability to build cloud-based systems that can manage structured data efficiently. I apply the same skills outside of coursework to create user workflow systems. This further strengthens my expertise.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        Developing a security mindset was a recurring theme throughout the program. For instance, while working on database integration, I implemented input validation and error-handling measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities and followed AWS API Gateway Security best practices in protecting my REST API. These practices reflect my commitment to designing secure systems that prioritize data privacy and system reliability. Additionally, in a cybersecurity module, I learned to identify and mitigate common security flaws, which further informed my approach to secure software development.

                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        The embedded thermostat system I chose for enhancement was developed for the TI SimpleLink WiFi CC3220S LaunchXL platform. This system can read ambient temperatures, adjust a set-point target, and control heating elements based on changes in temperature. This system integrates hardware and software components to demonstrate proficiency in embedded systems programming. This artifact was originally created for my CS 350 coursework which focused on embedded system and programmable logical. It has been refined since then to incorporate advanced software engineering concepts, improving its functionality and efficiency.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        This artifact was chosen for my ePortfolio as it demonstrates my ability to design and implement an actual embedded system. This artifact demonstrates essential skills for computer science positions that require a solid understanding of both hardware and software interfaces. My commitment to clean, maintainable design is reflected in the modular code structure that organizes tasks like temperature reading, handling user input, updating displays, and controlling heaters. My understanding of real-time performance optimization reflects in the addition of a prioritization-based scheduling system, which enables more efficient task management. In addition, I used defensive programming, error handling and initialization routines to create a fault-tolerant and robust system. This part of the enhancement shows my ability to build resilient software capable of handling unexpected errors gracefully. The extensive documentation and the clear variable naming standards emphasize readability. This makes the codebase simpler for future developers.

                        The artifact is a significant improvement over its original form and has been improved in many ways. It now features a modular design that separates the major functionality into functions. This improves readability and facilitates debugging and testing. I replaced hard-coded constants with named ones, making system settings clearer and easier to modify. The error-handling routines improved system stability by adding resilience to UART/I2C communication, and handling device failures. Moreover, I implemented an optimization system based on priority that prioritizes time-sensitive tasks and reduces the frequency of checking.

This system can read ambient temperatures, adjust a set-point target, and control heating elements based on changes in temperature. This system integrates hardware and software components to demonstrate proficiency in embedded systems programming. This artifact was originally created for my CS 350 coursework which focused on embedded system and programmable logic. This artifact manages user-defined set-points for temperature, monitors ambient temperature in real-time, and controls a heating element. Initially, the artifact used a loop-based scheduling mechanism for managing multiple tasks, such as temperature reading, button handling, and heating control. This approach, while functional, lacked efficiency and scalability, making it an ideal candidate for enhancements in the algorithms and data structures category.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        This artifact has been selected to be included in my ePortfolio as it demonstrates my ability to implement and optimize algorithms in a real embedded system. This artifact can be enhanced to showcase my key skills, such as task planning, algorithm design and efficiency optimization. These are all critical in solving complex computing problems.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        Several improvements have been made. A priority-based scheduler was introduced instead of one that used polling of a timer. The importance of tasks like temperature checks, button handling and display updates is now based on time. A priority queue was implemented to manage tasks efficiently. To ensure tasks are completed in order, they are given a priority and a deadline. A priority queue also eliminated redundant loops and checks, reducing the computational load of the system. The data structure was added to store the readings for display later or updating a database.

                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
