                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            A code review, after a developer completes the coding process, is an essential step to the development of software. It allows a second viewpoint on the implementation and solution before the branch can be merged with an upstream branch such as a feature or main branch. Reviewers can act as second steps in finding bugs, logic issues, edge cases or other issues.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">
                            Developing a strong code review process sets a foundation for continuous improvement and prevents unstable code from shipping to customers. Code reviews should become part of a software development team’s process to improve code quality and provide transparency to the codebase. The code review process is also an important part in spreading knowledge throughout an organization.

                        Several improvements have been made. A priority-based scheduler was introduced instead of one that used polling of a timer. The importance of tasks like temperature checks, button handling and display updates is now based on time. A priority queue was implemented to manage tasks efficiently. To ensure tasks are completed in order, they are given a priority and a deadline. A priority queue also eliminated redundant loops and checks, reducing the computational load of the system. The data structure was added to store the readings for display later or updating a database.

                        The artifact selected for this milestone is an Embedded Thermostat System developed for the TI SimpleLink WiFi CC3220S LaunchXL platform with integrated cloud-based data logging and retrieval functionalities. Initially created during CS 350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies, this system was designed to read and control temperature settings while managing heating or cooling units. The database integration enhancement adds the ability to store real-time sensor data and user-defined settings in a cloud-hosted MongoDB database. The artifact also incorporates an AWS Lambda-based API to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for seamless communication between the embedded system and the database.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        The artifact has undergone several significant enhancements:
                        Database Integration - added MongoDB/DocumentDB support for storing real-time temperature readings, set-point values, and system statuses.
                        CRUD Operations via REST API and AWS Lambda functions were developed to provide API endpoints for the embedded system, allowing external systems or applications to retrieve and modify thermostat data.
                        Data Validation and Error Handling - robust error-handling mechanisms were implemented in both the embedded system and the Lambda functions to ensure data integrity and mitigate potential security risks.
                        Performance Optimization - in the design are query optimizations to ensure efficient data retrieval for real-time monitoring.
                        Modular Design - the database-related logic was modularized to make the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
