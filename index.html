                                <h3>Coursework and Skill Development</h3>
                                Collaborating in a Team Environment
                                My career has always been enhanced by working collaboratively. I lead teams to develop user-centered software applications using tools like GitHub for versioning and Slack as a communication tool in both architecture and software engineering tasks. This program has enhanced my experience by working with other tools and reporting my progress to professors and fellow students. I worked with colleagues to develop scalable software during my daily work and this course re-enforces the importance of adaptability and empathy in creating productive team environments.
                                Communicating with Stakeholders
                                Effective communication is another essential skill I work on constantly and this course makes this a key focus. For example, I created a technical report and presentation to explain how integrating AWS Lambda and MongoDB enhanced an embedded system. By simplifying complex technical concepts for a non-technical audience, I demonstrated my ability to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders. This skill will be crucial as I pursue a career in technology, where clear and tailored communication drives successful projects.
                                Data Structures and Algorithms
                                Mastering data structures and algorithms is critical for all my work when developing efficient and scalable solutions. In one project, I designed and implemented a priority-based task scheduler for an embedded thermostat system. This required analyzing trade-offs between performance and responsiveness, ensuring that the scheduler met real-time requirements. These experiences have prepared me to design computing solutions that address complex challenges effectively.
                                Software Engineering and Databases
                                The program gave me a solid foundation in database management and software engineering. Modularizing the code for the Embedded Thermostat System improved readability and maintainability. This demonstrated my ability to use industry best practices. Integrating MongoDB with AWS Lambda also demonstrated my ability to build cloud-based systems that can manage structured data efficiently. I apply the same skills outside of coursework to create user workflow systems. This further strengthens my expertise.
                                Security
                                Developing a security mindset was a recurring theme throughout the program. For instance, while working on database integration, I implemented input validation and error-handling measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities and followed AWS API Gateway Security best practices in protecting my REST API. These practices reflect my commitment to designing secure systems that prioritize data privacy and system reliability. Additionally, in a cybersecurity module, I learned to identify and mitigate common security flaws, which further informed my approach to secure software development.
